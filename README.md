# Asteroids

A simple JavaScript and HTML Canvas game. ([Live demo on GitHub Pages](http://toomanybees.github.io/asteroids/))

This started out as a simple exercise in prototypal inheritance, but I expanded it to include weapons, extra lives, and a score (the trappings of a real game).

'W' is thrust, 'A' and 'D' are rotate, 'space' is shoot, and ` pauses the game..

Uses the [Keymaster library](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster) for key input.

## To Do
