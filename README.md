# Asteroids

A simple JavaScript and HTML Canvas game. ([Live demo on GitHub Pages](http://toomanybees.github.io/asteroids/))

'W' is thrust, 'A' and 'D' are rotate, 'space' is shoot, and ` pauses the game..

Uses the [Keymaster library](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster) for key input.

## To Do

* The game includes multiple weapons, but no option for selecting any. In the future, add pickup-items to the field that will upgrade the ship.
* Infinite game length with an ever-increasing upper limit of asteroids on the field.
